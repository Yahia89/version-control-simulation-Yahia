it will be a bit challenging for the folks who are going to take and follow the steps mentioned in the assignment only.
technically they need to use the upstream command `git push --set-upstream origin feature/header` or the footer one, one by one as they create branches, otherwise the branches won't be pushed onto the remote repo.

i had to re do the upstream commands (after i was done) since i didn't see the feature branches in the remote repo.

i handled the conflict manually, i removed the footer that i didn't want and kept what i wanted.

since i didn't do the upstream command at each time i created the feature repos , i didn't have to do the pull request on my end, nut now i understand the flow better since i took extra time investigating that, i'm happy.
